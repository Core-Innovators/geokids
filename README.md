# GeoKids

GeoKids is a university group project developed by Core Innovators.  
It is a complete solution that combines a **mobile application** for parents and students with an **admin dashboard** for admins.  

The system focuses on:
- ✅ Ensuring safe school transportation  
- ✅ Providing real-time updates and alerts for parents  
- ✅ Streamlining communication between parents, and drivers  

This repository contains both:
- **Mobile App** (`/mobile-app`) – built for Android
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin-dashboard`) – web-based management system
